    =&gt;  &quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies. &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently. READ: Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo. The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job. Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot; READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group. READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style. &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that&apos;s very attacking or a 3-4-3 that&apos;s very defensive and vice versa.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;
    =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.  Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him. Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport. &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister. &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training. &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics. &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden. &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships. Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;
    =&gt;  &quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally.

    =&gt;  &quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation. USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;

Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country.  That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter. Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;

 =&gt;  [ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;, body=&quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies. &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;, body=&quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently. READ: Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo. The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job. Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto.

The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;, body=&quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him. Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport. &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister. &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training. &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics. &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden. &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships. Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation. USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;, body=&quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter. Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;]
 =&gt;  [ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;, body=&quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies.  &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;, body=&quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently.  READ:  Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo.  The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job.  Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot;  READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile.

READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style.  &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence.

The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.  Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;, body=&quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him.  Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport.  &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister.  &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training.  &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs.  &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics.  &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden.  &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink.  &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships.  Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule.  His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see.  Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult.   That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men.  By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years.  &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition.  Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor.  &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot;  &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week.  Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports.  Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release.  It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy.  CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday.  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday.  Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar.  Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics.  Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000.  Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch.  He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot;  Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member.  The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said.  &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said.  Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot;  In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers.  The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot;  USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.  USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said.  The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN.  Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way.  &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot;  Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms.  The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country.  Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot;  Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive.  Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions.  &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country.  That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;, body=&quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter.  Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs.  She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department.   Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020.  When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line.  Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes.  Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration.  Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed. &quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue.  A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him.  A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof.  &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot;  Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw:   What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews?   The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries.   Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels.  But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended.   Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot;  &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd.  &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot;  Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world.   Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun  The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants.  &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot;  McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures:   Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot;    The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot;  Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot;   There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end.  &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church.  You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta.   &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot;  McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship.  But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit.  &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot;   Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either.   It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving.  &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot;  Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says.  &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos;  Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship.  What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot;  &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot;  Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot;   David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot;   Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot;   And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith:  &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot;  &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot;  Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as  &quot;tone deaf.&quot;   But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family.  He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;]

Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked.

Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker.

For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently. READ: Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo. The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job. Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot; READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group. READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style. &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that&apos;s very attacking or a 3-4-3 that&apos;s very defensive and vice versa.&quot;&quot;&gt;

[2] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Pentagon to send 5,000 troops to border as migrants inch closer&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;

We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;
[2].body =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.

[4] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence.

[4] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule.  His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see.  Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said.

[5] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep.

Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep.

Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics.

The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;
[5] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult.   That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men.

[6] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member.

[6] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports.  Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release.  It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy.  CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday.  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday.  Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar.  Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics.  Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000.  Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch.  He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot;  Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member.  The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said.  &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children.

[7] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;&gt;

He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot;  Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms.  The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country.  Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot;  Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive.  Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions.  &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country.  That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;

When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes.

[9] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;

A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker.

    =&gt;  &quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently. READ: Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo. The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job. Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot; READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group. READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style. &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that&apos;s very attacking or a 3-4-3 that&apos;s very defensive and vice versa.&quot;&quot;

Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot;  READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group. READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style.  &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that&apos;s very attacking or a 3-4-3 that&apos;s very defensive and vice versa.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him. Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport. &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup.

Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training. &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics. &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden. &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey?

    =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;
    =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule.  His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see.  Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation. USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;

We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said.  Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot;  In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers.  The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot;  USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.  USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter. Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;
    =&gt;  &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him.

What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot;  &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot;  Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot;   David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot;   Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot;   And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith:  &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot;  &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot;  Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as  &quot;tone deaf.&quot;   But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family.  He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;

 =&gt;  [ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;, body=&quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies. &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;, body=&quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently. READ: Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo. The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job. Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot; READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group. READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style. &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation.

The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;, body=&quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him. Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport. &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister. &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training. &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics. &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden. &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships. Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation. USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;, body=&quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter. Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;]
 =&gt;  [ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;, body=&quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies.  &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;, body=&quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently.  READ:  Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo.  The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job.  Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot;  READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group. READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style.  &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation.

The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.  Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;, body=&quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him.  Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport.  &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister.  &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training.  &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs.  &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics.  &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden.  &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink.  &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships.  Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule.  His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see.  Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult.   That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men.  By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years.  &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition.  Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor.  &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot;  &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week.  Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports.  Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release.  It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy.  CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday.  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday.  Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar.  Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics.  Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000.  Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch.  He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot;  Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member.  The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said.  &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said.  Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot;  In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers.  The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot;  USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.  USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said.  The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN.  Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way.  &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot;  Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms.  The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country.  Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot;  Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive.  Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions.  &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country.  That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;, body=&quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter.  Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs.  She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department.   Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020.  When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line.  Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes.  Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration.  Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed. &quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue.  A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him.  A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof.  &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot;  Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw:   What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews?   The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries.   Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels.  But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended.   Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot;  &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd.  &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot;  Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world.   Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun  The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants.  &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot;  McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures:   Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot;    The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot;  Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot;   There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end.  &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church.  You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta.   &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot;  McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship.  But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit.  &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot;   Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either.   It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving.  &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot;  Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says.  &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos;  Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship.  What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot;  &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot;  Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot;   David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot;   Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot;   And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith:  &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot;  &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot;  Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as  &quot;tone deaf.&quot;   But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family.  He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;]

He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;
[0].body =&gt;  &quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President.

[2] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Pentagon to send 5,000 troops to border as migrants inch closer&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;
[2] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Pentagon to send 5,000 troops to border as migrants inch closer&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.  Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;

So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister.  &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training.  &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs.  &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics.  &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden.  &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink.  &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships.  Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;

[4] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;

He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;

[5] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;

Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men.  By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years.  &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition.  Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor.  &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot;  &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week.  Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;

Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.

[7] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;&gt;

It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association.

[7].body =&gt;  &quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country.

[8] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;, body=&quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter. Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official.

[9] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;

So he can whack the wolf.&quot;  Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw:   What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews?   The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries.   Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels.  But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended.   Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot;  &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd.  &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot;  Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world.   Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun  The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants.  &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot;  McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures:   Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot;    The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot;  Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot;   There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end.  &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church.  You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta.   &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot;  McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship.  But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit.  &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot;   Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either.   It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving.  &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot;  Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says.  &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos;  Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship.  What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot;  &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot;  Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot;   David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot;   Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot;   And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith:  &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot;  &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot;  Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as  &quot;tone deaf.&quot;   But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family.  He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;

[9].body =&gt;  &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him.

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. \&quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,\&quot; Chappelle said, \&quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.\&quot; \&quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,\&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets \&quot;too much credit\&quot; for defining the era. \&quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.\&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered \&quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s\&quot; opening monologue. \&quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,\&quot; he said at the time. \&quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.\&quot; It was the \&quot;right thing at the right time\&quot; to say, he now opines. \&quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.\&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. \&quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.\&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said \&quot;there was a part of me\&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, \&quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;\&quot; \&quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.\&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former \&quot;Daily Show\&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies.  \&quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,\&quot; Stewart said. \&quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;football&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;SPORT&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the \&quot;impossible job,\&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision \&quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.\&quot; \&quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.\&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently.  READ:  Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plze? in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo.  The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job.  Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed \&quot;El Indiecito\&quot; -- \&quot;the Little Indian\&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed \&quot;El Indio.\&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the \&quot;Galacticos\&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him \&quot;The sexiest player of the year.\&quot; \&quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,\&quot; Solari quipped. \&quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.\&quot;  READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Pe?arol. Solari has been described as \&quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.\&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group.

Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gr?fico magazine provides a clue. \&quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style.  \&quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that&apos;s very attacking or a 3-4-3 that&apos;s very defensive and vice versa.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Pentagon to send 5,000 troops to border as migrants inch closer&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;POLITICS&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. \&quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,\&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. \&quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance\&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to \&quot;harden and secure the border.\&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that \&quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,\&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has \&quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals\&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  \&quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,\&quot; McAleenan said. \&quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.\&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.  Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from \&quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.\&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that \&quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.\&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is \&quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.\&quot; \&quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,\&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base \&quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,\&quot; the three wrote. \&quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.\&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes \&quot;gang members and some very bad people.\&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant \&quot;invasions,\&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  \&quot;Please go back,\&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. \&quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!\&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   \&quot;Operation Faithful Patriot\&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, \&quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.\&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers \&quot;are on their way to Texas right now.\&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to \&quot;bolster our capabilities\&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and \&quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.\&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the \&quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;\&quot;What is hockey?\&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him.  Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport.  \&quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,\&quot; Bellemare says, \&quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.\&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister.  \&quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;\&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training.  \&quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,\&quot; he laughs.  \&quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; \&quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.\&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics.  \&quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.\&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he \&quot;broke his leg one day.\&quot; \&quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden.  \&quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. \&quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink.  \&quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.\&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships.  Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. \&quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,\&quot; he said. \&quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;POLITICS&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called \&quot;presidential\&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule.  His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. \&quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,\&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media \&quot;the true enemy of the people.\&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see.  Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. \&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,\&quot; Sanders said. \&quot;The President is going to defend himself.\&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the \&quot;enemy of the people\&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. \&quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,\&quot; Sanders said. \&quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  \&quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,\&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. \&quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,\&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s \&quot;Bend the Arc\&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years \&quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,\&quot; and that he is not welcome until he \&quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.\&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that \&quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.\&quot; \&quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,\&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like \&quot;I hear you\&quot; and \&quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?\&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. \&quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,\&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a \&quot;transitional\&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. \&quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,\&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. \&quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,\&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  \&quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,\&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. \&quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.\&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult.   That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. \&quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,\&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote \&quot;present\&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. \&quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,\&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. \&quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.\&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the \&quot;transition\&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men.  By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. \&quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,\&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. \&quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.\&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years.  \&quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,\&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. \&quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,\&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition.  Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that \&quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.\&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a \&quot;desperate\&quot; attempt to become speaker \&quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.\&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a \&quot;safe place\&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor.  \&quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,\&quot; he said. \&quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.\&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a \&quot;lame duck.\&quot;  \&quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,\&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week.  Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need \&quot;far greater clarity\&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for \&quot;six months\&quot; or multiple years. \&quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.\&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. \&quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,\&quot; she said. \&quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.\&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. \&quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),\&quot; said one Democratic member. \&quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports.  Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 \&quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,\&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release.  It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy.  CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday.  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they \&quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3\&quot; on Friday.  Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar.  Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics.  Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: \&quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,\&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000.  Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch.  He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and \&quot;other enablers of this abuse.\&quot;  Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member.  The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said.  \&quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,\&quot; she said.  Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that \&quot;put its own self-interest before participants.\&quot;  In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is \&quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers.  The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.\&quot;  USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.  USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;POLITICS&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. \&quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,\&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President \&quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.\&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. \&quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,\&quot; Bloomberg said.  The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN.  Bloomberg said \&quot;perhaps\&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way.  \&quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.\&quot;  Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. \&quot;Not every Republican is a racist,\&quot; he said. \&quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.\&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: \&quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.\&quot; Bloomberg also said there are \&quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.\&quot; \&quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.\&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms.  The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country.  Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a \&quot;competent American\&quot; -- jumps in the race. \&quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.\&quot;  Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as \&quot;somebody who actually does things\&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive.  Bloomberg said while he thought \&quot;a large percentage\&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions.  \&quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.\&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country.  That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. \&quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,\&quot; Watts said. \&quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.\&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  \&quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.\&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, \&quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.\&quot; \&quot;We should have reasonable background checks,\&quot; Bloomberg added. \&quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.\&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue \&quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.\&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter.  Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs.  She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department.   Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020.  When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a \&quot;fantastic person\&quot; who has \&quot;done an incredible job\&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line.  Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes.  Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration.  Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the \&quot;sherpa\&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed. &quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue.  A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him.  A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in \&quot;ethical eating.\&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as \&quot;shepherds\&quot; as proof.  \&quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,\&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. \&quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.\&quot;  Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw:   What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews?   The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries.   Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels.  But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. \&quot;I hate that this keeps happening,\&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended.   Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be \&quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\&quot;  \&quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,\&quot; says Boyd.  \&quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.\&quot;  Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world.   Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun  The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants.  \&quot;That&apos;s absurd,\&quot; he says. \&quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.\&quot;  McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures:   Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, \&quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.\&quot;    The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that \&quot;are not the weapons of the world.\&quot;  Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: \&quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.\&quot;   There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end.  \&quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,\&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church.  You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta.   \&quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,\&quot; McDonald says. \&quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.\&quot;  McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of \&quot;no guns\&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship.  But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit.  \&quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,\&quot; McDonald says. \&quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.\&quot;   Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either.   It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving.  \&quot;I am not for arming pastors,\&quot; he says. \&quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.\&quot;  Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. \&quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,\&quot; he says.  &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos;  Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship.  What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because \&quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.\&quot;  \&quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,\&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. \&quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.\&quot;  Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, \&quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.\&quot;   David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, \&quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.\&quot;   Nehemiah 4:14 says, \&quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.\&quot;   And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith:  \&quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.\&quot;  \&quot;He goes with a militia of people,\&quot; Norry says. \&quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.\&quot;  Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as  \&quot;tone deaf.\&quot;   But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family.  He says violence is justified, \&quot;even holy,\&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  \&quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,\&quot; he says. \&quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?\&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  \&quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  \&quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.\&quot;&quot;,

    =&gt;  &quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies. &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently. READ: Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo. The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job. Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot; READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group. READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style. &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that&apos;s very attacking or a 3-4-3 that&apos;s very defensive and vice versa.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;

Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him. Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport. &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister. &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training. &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics. &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden. &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships. Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;
    =&gt;  &quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult.   That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep.

    =&gt;  &quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation. USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;

It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter. Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;

 =&gt;  [ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;, body=&quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies. &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;, body=&quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently. READ: Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo. The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job. Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot; READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile.

The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;, body=&quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him. Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport. &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister. &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training. &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics. &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden. &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships. Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation. USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;, body=&quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter. Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;]
 =&gt;  [ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;, body=&quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies.  &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;, body=&quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently.  READ:  Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo.  The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job.  Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot;  READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016.

READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style.  &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation.

The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.  Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;, body=&quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him.  Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport.  &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister.  &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training.  &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs.  &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics.  &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden.  &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink.  &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships.  Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule.  His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see.  Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult.   That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men.  By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years.  &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition.  Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor.  &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot;  &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week.  Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports.  Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release.  It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy.  CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday.  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday.  Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar.  Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics.  Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000.  Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch.  He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot;  Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member.  The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said.  &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said.  Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot;  In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers.  The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot;  USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.  USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said.  The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN.  Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way.  &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot;  Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms.  The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country.  Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot;  Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive.  Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions.  &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country.  That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;, body=&quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter.  Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs.  She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department.   Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020.  When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line.  Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes.  Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration.  Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed. &quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue.  A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him.  A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof.  &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot;  Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw:   What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews?   The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries.   Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels.  But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended.   Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot;  &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd.  &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot;  Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world.   Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun  The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants.  &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot;  McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures:   Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot;    The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot;  Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot;   There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end.  &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church.  You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta.   &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot;  McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship.  But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit.  &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot;   Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either.   It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving.  &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot;  Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says.  &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos;  Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship.  What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot;  &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot;  Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot;   David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot;   Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot;   And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith:  &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot;  &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot;  Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as  &quot;tone deaf.&quot;   But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family.  He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;]

[2] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Pentagon to send 5,000 troops to border as migrants inch closer&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;

Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;
[2].body =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.  Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN.

[4] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;

Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule.  His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see.  Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;

[5] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics.

[5] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult.   That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men.  By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years.  &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition.  Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor.  &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot;  &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week.

[6] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation. USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;&gt;

She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000.  Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch.  He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot;  Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member.  The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said.  &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said.  Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot;  In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers.  The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot;  USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.  USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;&gt;

[6].body =&gt;  &quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono.

[7] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;&gt;

Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;

Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official.

[9] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;

Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;
[9].body =&gt;  &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue.  A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him.  A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof.  &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot;  Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw:   What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews?   The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries.   Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels.  But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended.   Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot;  &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd.  &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot;  Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world.   Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun  The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants.  &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot;  McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures:   Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot;    The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot;  Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats.

    =&gt;  &quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker.

READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style.  &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that&apos;s very attacking or a 3-4-3 that&apos;s very defensive and vice versa.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him. Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport. &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister. &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training. &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics. &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden. &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships. Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;

At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation. USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;
    =&gt;  &quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said.  The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN.  Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way.  &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing.

    =&gt;  &quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter. Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed.&quot;

    =&gt;  &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;

He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;

 =&gt;  [ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;, body=&quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies. &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;, body=&quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently. READ: Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo. The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job. Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed &quot;El Indiecito&quot; -- &quot;the Little Indian&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed &quot;El Indio.&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the &quot;Galacticos&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him &quot;The sexiest player of the year.&quot; &quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,&quot; Solari quipped. &quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.&quot; READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Peñarol. Solari has been described as &quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group. READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gráfico magazine provides a clue. &quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style. &quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that&apos;s very attacking or a 3-4-3 that&apos;s very defensive and vice versa.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Pentagon to send 5,000 troops to border as migrants inch closer&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;, body=&quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him. Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport. &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister. &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training. &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics. &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden. &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships. Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation. USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;, body=&quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter. Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;]
 =&gt;  [ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;, body=&quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. &quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,&quot; Chappelle said, &quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.&quot; &quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets &quot;too much credit&quot; for defining the era. &quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered &quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s&quot; opening monologue. &quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.&quot; It was the &quot;right thing at the right time&quot; to say, he now opines. &quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. &quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said &quot;there was a part of me&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, &quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;&quot; &quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies.  &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;, body=&quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the &quot;impossible job,&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision &quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.&quot; &quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently.  READ:  Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plzeň in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo.  The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job.  Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good.

The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.  Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;, body=&quot;&quot;What is hockey?&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him.  Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport.  &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister.  &quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training.  &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs.  &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics.  &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden.  &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. &quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink.  &quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships.  Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule.  His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see.  Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult.   That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men.  By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years.  &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition.  Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor.  &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot;  &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week.  Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports.  Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release.  It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy.  CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday.  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday.  Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar.  Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics.  Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000.  Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch.  He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot;  Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member.  The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said.  &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said.  Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot;  In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers.  The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot;  USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.  USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said.  The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN.  Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way.  &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot;  Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms.  The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country.  Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot;  Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive.  Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions.  &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country.  That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;, body=&quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter.  Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs.  She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department.   Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020.  When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line.  Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes.  Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration.  Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed. &quot;&gt;, ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue.  A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him.  A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof.  &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot;  Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw:   What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews?   The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries.   Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels.  But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended.   Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot;  &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd.  &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot;  Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world.   Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun  The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants.  &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot;  McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures:   Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot;    The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot;  Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot;   There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end.  &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church.  You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta.   &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot;  McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship.  But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit.  &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot;   Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either.   It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving.  &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot;  Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says.  &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos;  Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship.  What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot;  &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot;  Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot;   David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot;   Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot;   And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith:  &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot;  &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot;  Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as  &quot;tone deaf.&quot;   But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family.  He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;]

Pointing fingers at the press, the former &quot;Daily Show&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies.  &quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.&quot;&quot;

[2] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Pentagon to send 5,000 troops to border as migrants inch closer&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.&quot; &quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky. Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law. Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border. Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot; The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border. &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California. Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said. A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed. Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot; Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north. The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops. Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot; This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon. Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;

Stoking the base &quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,&quot; the three wrote. &quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes &quot;gang members and some very bad people.&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant &quot;invasions,&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  &quot;Please go back,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. &quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   &quot;Operation Faithful Patriot&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, &quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers &quot;are on their way to Texas right now.&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to &quot;bolster our capabilities&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and &quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the &quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.&quot;&quot;&gt;

[2].body =&gt;  &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday. The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. &quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. &quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to &quot;harden and secure the border.&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night. There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that &quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law. The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has &quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control. &quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,&quot; McAleenan said. &quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers. Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from &quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that &quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is &quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children.

Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him. Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport. &quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,&quot; Bellemare says, &quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup.

Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training. &quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; &quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics. &quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he &quot;broke his leg one day.&quot; &quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden. &quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey?

Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. &quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,&quot; he said. &quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.&quot;&quot;

[4] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;, body=&quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called &quot;presidential&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule. His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. &quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media &quot;the true enemy of the people.&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see. Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;The President is going to defend himself.&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. &quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,&quot; Sanders said. &quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made. &quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. &quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s &quot;Bend the Arc&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years &quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,&quot; and that he is not welcome until he &quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that &quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like &quot;I hear you&quot; and &quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. &quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,&quot; Sanders said. Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;&gt;

Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;

[5] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;, body=&quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a &quot;transitional&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. &quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. &quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent. &quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. &quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult. That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. &quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote &quot;present&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. &quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. &quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the &quot;transition&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men. By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. &quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. &quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years. &quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition. Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor. &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot; &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week. Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;&gt;

Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. &quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition.  Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that &quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a &quot;desperate&quot; attempt to become speaker &quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a &quot;safe place&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor.  &quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a &quot;lame duck.&quot;  &quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week.  Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need &quot;far greater clarity&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for &quot;six months&quot; or multiple years. &quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. &quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,&quot; she said. &quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. &quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),&quot; said one Democratic member. &quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.&quot;&quot;

[6] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;, body=&quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports. Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 &quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release. It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy. CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday. In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they &quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3&quot; on Friday. Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics. Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: &quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000. Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch. He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and &quot;other enablers of this abuse.&quot; Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member. The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said. &quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,&quot; she said. Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that &quot;put its own self-interest before participants.&quot; In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is &quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers. The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.&quot; USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.

[7] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;, body=&quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. &quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue.

He went on to say that the President &quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. &quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,&quot; Bloomberg said. The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN. Bloomberg said &quot;perhaps&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way. &quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.&quot; Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. &quot;Not every Republican is a racist,&quot; he said. &quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: &quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.&quot; Bloomberg also said there are &quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms. The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country. Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a &quot;competent American&quot; -- jumps in the race. &quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.&quot; Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as &quot;somebody who actually does things&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive. Bloomberg said while he thought &quot;a large percentage&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions. &quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country. That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies. He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. &quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,&quot; Watts said. &quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action. &quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, &quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.&quot; &quot;We should have reasonable background checks,&quot; Bloomberg added. &quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.&quot; Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue &quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association.

[8] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;, body=&quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter. Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs. She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department. Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020. When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a &quot;fantastic person&quot; who has &quot;done an incredible job&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line. Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes. Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration. Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the &quot;sherpa&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed.&quot;&gt;

[9] =&gt;  ResultDTO&lt;headline=&quot;There&apos;s scripture backing up Trump&apos;s idea to arm houses of worship&quot;, body=&quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world. Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants. &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot; McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures: Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot; The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot; Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot; There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end. &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church. You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot; McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship. But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit. &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot; Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either. It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving. &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot; Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says. &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos; Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship. What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot; &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot; Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot; David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot; Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot; And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith: &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot; &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot; Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as &quot;tone deaf.&quot; But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family. He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation. &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot; It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship. He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services. Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs. They would still welcome the stranger. But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door. &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos; &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;

Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun  The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants.  &quot;That&apos;s absurd,&quot; he says. &quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.&quot;  McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures:   Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, &quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.&quot;    The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that &quot;are not the weapons of the world.&quot;  Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: &quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.&quot;   There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end.  &quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church.  You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta.   &quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.&quot;  McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of &quot;no guns&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship.  But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit.  &quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,&quot; McDonald says. &quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.&quot;   Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either.   It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving.  &quot;I am not for arming pastors,&quot; he says. &quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.&quot;  Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. &quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,&quot; he says.  &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos;  Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship.  What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because &quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.&quot;  &quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. &quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.&quot;  Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, &quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.&quot;   David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, &quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.&quot;   Nehemiah 4:14 says, &quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.&quot;   And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith:  &quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.&quot;  &quot;He goes with a militia of people,&quot; Norry says. &quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.&quot;  Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as  &quot;tone deaf.&quot;   But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family.  He says violence is justified, &quot;even holy,&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  &quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,&quot; he says. &quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  &quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  &quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.&quot;&quot;&gt;

[9].body =&gt;  &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue. A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him. A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in &quot;ethical eating.&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as &quot;shepherds&quot; as proof. &quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. &quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.&quot; Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw: What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews? The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries. Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels. But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. &quot;I hate that this keeps happening,&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended. Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be &quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.&quot; &quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.&quot; Part of the preparation is scriptural.

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. \&quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,\&quot; Chappelle said, \&quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.\&quot; \&quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,\&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets \&quot;too much credit\&quot; for defining the era. \&quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.\&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered \&quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s\&quot; opening monologue. \&quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,\&quot; he said at the time. \&quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.\&quot; It was the \&quot;right thing at the right time\&quot; to say, he now opines. \&quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.\&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. \&quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.\&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said \&quot;there was a part of me\&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, \&quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;\&quot; \&quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.\&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former \&quot;Daily Show\&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies.  \&quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,\&quot; Stewart said. \&quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;football&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;SPORT&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the \&quot;impossible job,\&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision \&quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.\&quot; \&quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.\&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently.  READ:  Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plze? in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo.  The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job.  Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed \&quot;El Indiecito\&quot; -- \&quot;the Little Indian\&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed \&quot;El Indio.\&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the \&quot;Galacticos\&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him \&quot;The sexiest player of the year.\&quot; \&quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,\&quot; Solari quipped. \&quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.\&quot;  READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Pe?arol. Solari has been described as \&quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.\&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group. READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gr?fico magazine provides a clue. \&quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style.  \&quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that&apos;s very attacking or a 3-4-3 that&apos;s very defensive and vice versa.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Pentagon to send 5,000 troops to border as migrants inch closer&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;POLITICS&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. \&quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,\&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. \&quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance\&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to \&quot;harden and secure the border.\&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that \&quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,\&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has \&quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals\&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  \&quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,\&quot; McAleenan said. \&quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.\&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.  Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from \&quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.\&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that \&quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.\&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is \&quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.\&quot; \&quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,\&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base \&quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,\&quot; the three wrote. \&quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.\&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes \&quot;gang members and some very bad people.\&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant \&quot;invasions,\&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  \&quot;Please go back,\&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. \&quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!\&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   \&quot;Operation Faithful Patriot\&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, \&quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.\&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers \&quot;are on their way to Texas right now.\&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to \&quot;bolster our capabilities\&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and \&quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.\&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the \&quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;\&quot;What is hockey?\&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him.  Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport.  \&quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,\&quot; Bellemare says, \&quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.\&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister.  \&quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;\&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training.  \&quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,\&quot; he laughs.  \&quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; \&quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.\&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics.  \&quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.\&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he \&quot;broke his leg one day.\&quot; \&quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden.  \&quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. \&quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink.  \&quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.\&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships.  Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. \&quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,\&quot; he said. \&quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;POLITICS&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called \&quot;presidential\&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule.  His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. \&quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,\&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media \&quot;the true enemy of the people.\&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see.  Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. \&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,\&quot; Sanders said. \&quot;The President is going to defend himself.\&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the \&quot;enemy of the people\&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. \&quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,\&quot; Sanders said. \&quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  \&quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,\&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. \&quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,\&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s \&quot;Bend the Arc\&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years \&quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,\&quot; and that he is not welcome until he \&quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.\&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that \&quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.\&quot; \&quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,\&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like \&quot;I hear you\&quot; and \&quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?\&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. \&quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,\&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a \&quot;transitional\&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. \&quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,\&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. \&quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,\&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  \&quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,\&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. \&quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.\&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult.   That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. \&quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,\&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote \&quot;present\&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. \&quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,\&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. \&quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.\&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the \&quot;transition\&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men.  By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. \&quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,\&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. \&quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.\&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years.  \&quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,\&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. \&quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,\&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition.  Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that \&quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.\&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a \&quot;desperate\&quot; attempt to become speaker \&quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.\&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a \&quot;safe place\&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor.  \&quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,\&quot; he said. \&quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.\&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a \&quot;lame duck.\&quot;  \&quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,\&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week.  Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need \&quot;far greater clarity\&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for \&quot;six months\&quot; or multiple years. \&quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.\&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. \&quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,\&quot; she said. \&quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.\&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. \&quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),\&quot; said one Democratic member. \&quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports.  Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 \&quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,\&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release.  It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy.  CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday.  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they \&quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3\&quot; on Friday.  Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar.  Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics.  Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: \&quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,\&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000.  Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch.  He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and \&quot;other enablers of this abuse.\&quot;  Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member.  The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said.  \&quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,\&quot; she said.  Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that \&quot;put its own self-interest before participants.\&quot;  In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is \&quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers.  The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.\&quot;  USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.  USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;POLITICS&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. \&quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,\&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President \&quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.\&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. \&quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,\&quot; Bloomberg said.  The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN.  Bloomberg said \&quot;perhaps\&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way.  \&quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.\&quot;  Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. \&quot;Not every Republican is a racist,\&quot; he said. \&quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.\&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: \&quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.\&quot; Bloomberg also said there are \&quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.\&quot; \&quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.\&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms.  The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country.  Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a \&quot;competent American\&quot; -- jumps in the race. \&quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.\&quot;  Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as \&quot;somebody who actually does things\&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive.  Bloomberg said while he thought \&quot;a large percentage\&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions.  \&quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.\&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country.  That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. \&quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,\&quot; Watts said. \&quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.\&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  \&quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.\&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, \&quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.\&quot; \&quot;We should have reasonable background checks,\&quot; Bloomberg added. \&quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.\&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue \&quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.\&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter.  Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs.  She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department.   Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020.  When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a \&quot;fantastic person\&quot; who has \&quot;done an incredible job\&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line.  Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes.  Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration.  Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the \&quot;sherpa\&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed. &quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue.  A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him.  A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in \&quot;ethical eating.\&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as \&quot;shepherds\&quot; as proof.  \&quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,\&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. \&quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.\&quot;  Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw:   What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews?   The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries.   Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels.  But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. \&quot;I hate that this keeps happening,\&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended.   Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be \&quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\&quot;  \&quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,\&quot; says Boyd.  \&quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.\&quot;  Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world.   Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun  The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants.  \&quot;That&apos;s absurd,\&quot; he says. \&quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.\&quot;  McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures:   Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, \&quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.\&quot;    The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that \&quot;are not the weapons of the world.\&quot;  Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: \&quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.\&quot;   There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end.  \&quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,\&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church.  You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta.   \&quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,\&quot; McDonald says. \&quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.\&quot;  McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of \&quot;no guns\&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship.  But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit.  \&quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,\&quot; McDonald says. \&quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.\&quot;   Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either.   It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving.  \&quot;I am not for arming pastors,\&quot; he says. \&quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.\&quot;  Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. \&quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,\&quot; he says.  &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos;  Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship.  What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because \&quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.\&quot;  \&quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,\&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. \&quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.\&quot;  Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, \&quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.\&quot;   David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, \&quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.\&quot;   Nehemiah 4:14 says, \&quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.\&quot;   And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith:  \&quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.\&quot;  \&quot;He goes with a militia of people,\&quot; Norry says. \&quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.\&quot;  Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as  \&quot;tone deaf.\&quot;   But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family.  He says violence is justified, \&quot;even holy,\&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  \&quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,\&quot; he says. \&quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?\&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  \&quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  \&quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Dave Chappelle: Russia didn&apos;t make us racists&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Almost two years after President Trump&apos;s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump&apos;s election, or Russian meddling. \&quot;Even when they say that Russia influenced the election,\&quot; Chappelle said, \&quot;it&apos;s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who&apos;s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness -- I thought it was us.\&quot; \&quot;If they killed the country that way then we&apos;re the murder weapon,\&quot; he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets \&quot;too much credit\&quot; for defining the era. \&quot;He&apos;s not making the wave, he&apos;s surfing it.\&quot; The &apos;right thing at the right time&apos; Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered \&quot;Saturday Night Live&apos;s\&quot; opening monologue. \&quot;I&apos;m going to give him a chance,\&quot; he said at the time. \&quot;And we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.\&quot; It was the \&quot;right thing at the right time\&quot; to say, he now opines. \&quot;I&apos;m a black American, so we&apos;ve -- these feelings that people felt right after the election, we&apos;ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.\&quot; But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. \&quot;Is he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he&apos;s doing? No, it&apos;s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.\&quot; After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America&apos;s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said \&quot;there was a part of me\&quot; that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, \&quot;I imagine he walked in that room -- he&apos;s like, &apos;Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?&apos;\&quot; \&quot;Oddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn&apos;t able to transform him.\&quot; Trump versus the press Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former \&quot;Daily Show\&quot; host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies.  \&quot;I&apos;m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries -- in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,\&quot; Stewart said. \&quot;They are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Santiago Solari: Who is Real Madrid&apos;s interim coach?&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Santiago Hernan Solari knows what it takes to be a successful Real Madrid player. For his next trick, can he replicate that as interim coach of the La Liga club? If managing the England international team is the \&quot;impossible job,\&quot; then the Real hot seat is surely club football&apos;s equivalent -- as Julen Lopetegui quickly discovered when he was sacked on Monday after just two months in charge. Sunday&apos;s humiliating 5-1 El Clasico defeat at the Camp Nou left Los Blancos ninth in La Liga, seven points behind the league leaders and proved the final straw for Lopetegui, who was dismissed from his position as Spain coach on the eve of the World Cup after agreeing to take charge of Real for the start of the 2018/2019 season. An official Real statement thanked Lopetegui for his efforts but said the decision \&quot;aims to change the dynamics of the first team, when all the objectives of this season are still achievable.\&quot; \&quot;The board considers there to be a large disparity between the quality within the Real Madrid squad, which boasts eight nominees for the next Ballon d&apos;Or award -- an unprecedented number in the club&apos;s history -- and the team&apos;s results to date.\&quot; Solari, who has been the Real Madrid B coach, takes over on an interim basis. The club gave no indication of who they would appoint permanently.  READ:  Lopetegui sacked by Real Madrid &apos;El Indiecito&apos; Before the international break in mid November, Real plays Melilla in the Copa del Rey, hosts Real Valladolid in La Liga and faces Viktoria Plze? in the Champions League, before traveling to Galicia for an away league game against Celta Vigo.  The good news for Solari is that there is a successful precedent for Real president Florentino Perez promoting a Real Madrid B coach to the top job.  Zinedine Zidane left his role as Real boss in May this year having led his former club to nine trophies in a two-and-a-half year spell, including three consecutive European titles. He too had coached the Real Madrid B team. Born in Rosario, Argentina -- also the birthplace of Lionel Messi -- Solari was educated at New Jersey&apos;s Richard Stockton College in the US, which partly explains why the 42-year-old&apos;s English is so good. He likes to read in English to retain his ability to speak the language. Solari&apos;s father Eduardo played professionally in Argentina while his brothers David and Esteban also pursued football careers, as did his cousin Augusto. Solari was nicknamed \&quot;El Indiecito\&quot; -- \&quot;the Little Indian\&quot; -- which is a nod to his uncle, Jorge Solari, who played in Mexico and was nicknamed \&quot;El Indio.\&quot; READ: Suarez hat-trick helps Barca to El Clasico humbling &apos;Sexiest player of the year&apos; In Argentina, Solari&apos;s career took off at River Plate, where he won the Libertadores Cup in 1996. Three years later he made the move to Spain, joining Atletico Madrid. When Atletico was relegated in 2000, Real moved to sign the Argentine winger. That was the era of the \&quot;Galacticos\&quot; and Solari played alongside the likes of Zidane, featuring in 204 games and scoring 22 goals in five seasons as a merengue He won the Champions League in 2002 -- it was Solari that started the move that led to Zidane&apos;s breathtaking volley against Bayer Leverkusen in the final in Glasgow -- as well as two La Liga titles, two Spanish Supercups, one European Supercup and an Intercontinental Cup. It wasn&apos;t just football trophies that Solari won at Real. In 2002, Canal + viewers voted him \&quot;The sexiest player of the year.\&quot; \&quot;I thank the people who voted for me, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s rigged,\&quot; Solari quipped. \&quot;We&apos;ll see if I&apos;m offered another career in the film industry when I leave.\&quot;  READ: Leicester City -- Healing a broken city after &apos;horrific time for everybody&apos; Intensely private In 2005, Solari joined Inter Milan and was part of teams that won three successive Serie A titles, before he headed back to South America and played for San Lorenzo, Atlante and Pe?arol. Solari has been described as \&quot;highly educated, articulate, philosophical and a lover of books.\&quot; After retiring he wrote a column for leading Spanish newspaper El Pais. Married with three children, Solari is intensively private and has no visible social media profile. Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos Back in Europe, he started his coaching career by working with Real Madrid&apos;s junior teams, before taking charge of Castilla -- the club&apos;s B team -- in 2016. Under Solari, Castilla&apos;s results have been mixed -- in his three seasons in charge, the team finished 11th and eighth and is currently fifth in their group. READ: Emotional Mahrez scores winner for Man City on NFL scarred pitch What type of coach will Solari be at Real? Perhaps an interview he gave to El Gr?fico magazine provides a clue. \&quot;First you have to see what skills and what characteristics the players have -- who are and will always be the owners of football -- and afterwards know how I want to play, the style.  \&quot;Later, the football culture of each country, the competition, the opponent, the pitch, the tactics, etc. all influence. All of this is more important than the tactical formation. You can play with a 4-4-1-1 that&apos;s very attacking or a 3-4-3 that&apos;s very defensive and vice versa.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Pentagon to send 5,000 troops to border as migrants inch closer&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;POLITICS&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;President Donald Trump is sending 5,200 troops and a slew of military equipment to the southern border, doubling down on one of his favorite base-rallying issues with the midterm elections just days away. The troops, who will be at the border by the end of the week, are being deployed to stop Central American migrants bound for the US, according to Pentagon and Homeland Security officials who spoke Monday.  The migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border, are weeks away from arriving at the border where many reportedly plan to seek asylum. \&quot;Our concept of operations is to flow in our military assets with a priority to build up southern Texas, and then Arizona, and then California,\&quot; Gen. Terrence John O&apos;Shaughnessy said Monday, adding that the soldiers normally assigned weapons will be carrying them at the border. \&quot;We&apos;ll reinforce along priority points of entry, so as to enhance\&quot; the ability of Customs and Border Protection officers to \&quot;harden and secure the border.\&quot; &apos;Our message ... is simple&apos; The Pentagon will also send medical units, command posts, military police units and strategic airlift capabilities, including four large transport aircraft for deploying CBP personnel and helicopters equipped with sensors to operate at night.   There is already enough concertina wire at the border to cover 22 miles, O&apos;Shaughnessy said, with another 150 miles worth available. The general also told reporters that \&quot;everything we are doing is in line with and in adherence to Posse Comitatus,\&quot; the federal statute that forbids the use of the military to enforce domestic law.  The troops will supplement extra CBP officers, Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said. Speaking in Washington with O&apos;Shaughnessy, the commissioner said that DHS has \&quot;at the ready 1,000 CBP officers, including 250 tactical enforcement officers and mobile response team professionals\&quot; with training in managing contingencies, including riot control.  \&quot;Our message to the organizers and participants in the caravan is simple,\&quot; McAleenan said. \&quot;We will not allow a large group to enter to United States in an unsafe manner.\&quot; Neither McAleenan nor O&apos;Shaughnessy addressed what the extra deployments will cost taxpayers.  Critics decried the move as a political stunt meant, in part, to distract from \&quot;a serious attempted political assassination and media bombing campaign, and religious and racially motivated shootings.\&quot; Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, Rabbi David Saperstein, a former ambassador at large for international religious freedom, and Henry Fernandez, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement that \&quot;President Trump is manufacturing a crisis around the caravan for political gain -- to stoke fears and garner votes for the midterms.\&quot; The migrant group, they said in a statement, is hundreds of miles away from the US border, is \&quot;not threat to the country, it is shrinking in size, unarmed, and filled mostly with women and children. We have laws in place if the migrants reach the border.\&quot; \&quot;We are currently facing real threats, a series of hate crimes and hate-filled violence,\&quot; they added, pointing to the package bombs sent to prominent Democrats and to CNN, as well as the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a white man&apos;s killing of two black men in Kentucky.  Stoking the base \&quot;Instead of talking about the real threats and actual murders of innocent Americans, President Trump is doing his best to turn the nation&apos;s attention elsewhere for political  purposes,\&quot; the three wrote. \&quot;Trump and his allies on Fox News are consistently lying to position the caravan as a threat and to stoke their base.\&quot; Shaw Drake, a policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, noted that the military is legally barred from engaging in immigration enforcement, and that the asylum-seeking migrants are exercising a right that is protected by international and domestic law.  Trump has repeatedly warned of dangers related to immigration and of specific but unsubstantiated threats posed by the migrants, who are still weeks away from the US border.  Trump tweeted Monday that the group of Central Americans includes \&quot;gang members and some very bad people.\&quot;  The tweet to the President&apos;s 55.5 million followers came just two days after a man with virulently anti-immigrant views, who referred to immigrant \&quot;invasions,\&quot; killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue.  \&quot;Please go back,\&quot; Trump tweeted Monday to the migrants, who are some 900 miles away from the border and moving at a pace of 20 to 30 miles a day. \&quot;You will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!\&quot; The migrants are seeking asylum, which can be applied for only once someone seeking protection from persecution or fleeing violence in their home country is inside another country or is at the border.   \&quot;Operation Faithful Patriot\&quot; is expected to start on November 5 and last until December 15, a defense official told CNN. The current plan is to send the additional active duty troops to Brownsville, Texas, Nogales, Arizona and likely near San Diego, California.   Asked Monday whether the administration was considering closing the southern border, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, \&quot;we have a number of options on the table and we&apos;re exploring those.\&quot; The troops will include deployments from Fort Campbell and Fort Knox in Kentucky, O&apos;Shaunghnessy said.   A US official told CNN that verbal orders went out this past weekend to some units and that additional written orders started Monday. The official added that some troops were already moving and that their number could increase or decrease as needs are assessed.  Last week, CNN reported that the US could send 800 or more troops to the border. On Monday, O&apos;Shaughnessy said 800 soldiers \&quot;are on their way to Texas right now.\&quot;  Trump has said migrant groups will be a central issue of the campaign and has repeatedly linked them to Democrats. He threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries that allow the estimated 6,500 people fleeing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to continue moving north.  The US official and a defense official emphasized the troops will be at the border to support civil authorities and that they are not expected to come into any contact with migrants. If the troops carry arms, it will be solely for self defense, the officials said.  Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that her agency had asked for defense department help to \&quot;bolster our capabilities\&quot; in an effort to avoid a repeat of clashes on the Guatemalan-Mexican border between some of the northbound migrants and Mexican troops.    Specifically, she said DHS has asked for air, engineering, logistics and planning support as well as vehicle barriers and \&quot;ways in which we can protect my officers and agents as well as the ports of entry themselves.\&quot;     This deployment is separate from an ongoing National Guard effort to support border authorities with technical assistance. There are approximately 4,000 personnel authorized for that mission, but only 2,100 are currently in place, according to the Pentagon.  Asked why the President felt to compelled to send additional troops to do essentially the same thing, Sanders told reporters Monday that the \&quot;President&apos;s No. 1 job and No. 1 priority is to protect the safety and security of Americans, and he&apos;s going to do what he deems necessary in order to do that.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;&apos;What is hockey?&apos; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare&apos;s unlikely journey to the NHL&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;\&quot;What is hockey?\&quot; Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, at 16 years old, had to answer that question. Not existentially, but literally to the police officer in France who had stopped him.  Unaware of the sport, the officer had pulled him aside, chastised him for carrying a weapon in public and then expressed incredulity when told it was an instrument of sport.  \&quot;Our sport magazine we had when I was a kid,\&quot; Bellemare says, \&quot;I remember it was always one time a year, a sentence at the end, the last page, that team won the cup. That was it. So not really a popular sport.\&quot; READ: Filip Forsberg on his journey from Sweden to the Nashville Predators READ: Gabriel Landeskog -- From Stockholm to NHL stardom France, a country better known perhaps for its soccer, cycling and basketball, didn&apos;t place a high priority on hockey and the sport was foreign to Bellemare until a sudden inspiration to take it up struck his sister.  \&quot;My big sister ... somehow she wanted to start hockey. Why? I have no idea why, where she heard of it, but so my big brother and I were like, &apos;if she plays hockey, we want to also.&apos;\&quot; Financial limitations prevented the trio from truly diving into the sport at first, but a coach recognized the talent that Bellemare and his brother had and invited them back the next week to put them through training.  \&quot;We came back, and we did a bunch of drills that put us on our asses, like weird drills,\&quot; he laughs.  \&quot;But we had a blast, and after that, the coach went to my mom and was like, &apos;hockey or figure skating, choose one, but they shouldn&apos;t go and play soccer.&apos; \&quot;For me, I was always a kid who wanted to do something different.\&quot; A Canadian or American, he notes, might have turned their sights on the NHL, but for a fledgling player in hockey-depleted France, his main goal became the Olympics.  \&quot;I could never see the NHL [games]; there was no internet, no cable, it was purely the Olympics and you had to fight to see the games.\&quot; READ: The day the Stanley Cup went missing -- in Siberia READ: Golden Knights&apos; mission to heal through hockey Undeterred from his dream, but realistic about the prospects of playing professionally, Bellemare earned an education alongside his pursuit of a hockey career, a backup plan in case, in his words, he \&quot;broke his leg one day.\&quot; \&quot;When I was 21, I got my degrees, and it was a decision to make if I stay at the university or if I go to Sweden.  \&quot;It was really close that I stopped hockey to go to school because, I mean, how much can you live out of hockey? You&apos;re French right? And you hear that your entire life. \&quot;That&apos;s when I realized hockey is a job and you work, and not just working at the rink, it&apos;s the way you eat, the way you drink.  \&quot;That&apos;s when I realized, alright, this is going to be something I&apos;m going to do for a living.\&quot; Since those early days of running wild on the ice with his siblings, Bellemare has achieved incredible accomplishments: getting signed by the Philadelphia Flyers after a stint in Sweden, playing in the Stanley Cup Finals as part of the Vegas Golden Knights and representing his native France at multiple World Championships.  Bellemare&apos;s unlikely hockey journey is far from complete -- another goal still awaits. \&quot;I still haven&apos;t played in the Olympics,\&quot; he said. \&quot;And it&apos;s still my biggest dream technically to be able to represent my nation.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Defiant and divisive, Trump set to honor Pittsburgh victims&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;POLITICS&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;President Donald Trump travels to Pittsburgh on Tuesday after the worst anti-Semitic crime in American history, bringing with him a pulsing anger that his rhetoric is being blamed for the attack and intent on proving to his critics he can behave like a president. For Trump, the role of consoler has sometimes come uneasily and, in his view, without tangible benefit. Trump has complained in the past that so-called \&quot;presidential\&quot; moments have gone unnoticed by his critics and unheralded in the media, leading him to wonder what the point of it all was. This weekend, after Trump forcefully decried anti-Semitism during campaign appearances, he again protested to confidantes that the message wasn&apos;t received with praise, according to people familiar with the conversations. Along with many of his aides, he viewed the continued questions about his divisive rhetoric as petty partisan attacks launched by his political opponents. Still, after discussions with advisers that included daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who are Jewish, Trump declared his intent to visit Pittsburgh. The trip comes amid a last-minute midterm campaign push and has forestalled, for now, a planned address on immigration. Trump has expressed concern his midterm messaging could be knocked off-kilter by the attack. Pittsburgh&apos;s mayor called on Monday for Trump to wait to visit until after burials are complete, but with an 11-rally itinerary set for the end of the week, there was little flexibility in the President&apos;s schedule.  His daughter and Kushner, will join Trump in Pittsburgh, along with first lady Melania Trump, who has sometimes worked with mixed results to soften her husband&apos;s public image. He is expected to meet with some members of the Tree of Life congregation, who lost 11 members when a gunman opened fire inside the synagogue on Saturday morning. More grievance than grief In the wake of the slaying at the Pittsburgh synagogue, Trump has demonstrated more grievance than grief. Those grievances, once again, are rooted in how he innately believes he is being mistreated by the media. For days, he&apos;s been complaining openly to allies and aides that he doesn&apos;t believe he&apos;s been given sufficient credit for his early comments denouncing the shooting. But those comments were quickly overtaken by more inflammatory tweets from the President. Trump chose to use his bully pulpit on Monday by attacking the media -- not by calling out the anti-Semitic views of the gunman. \&quot;There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news,\&quot; Trump tweeted Monday, again calling the media \&quot;the true enemy of the people.\&quot; Those very public words help explain Trump&apos;s mindset, according to people who have spoken to him, who say his fury is out in the open for all to see.  Trump has said repeatedly he&apos;s committed to helping the nation heal its deep political schisms. Yet he&apos;s refused to acknowledge the role his own speech has played in the national divide. At the first White House briefing in 26 days, press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President on Monday and insisted he was being treated unfairly. She also repeatedly maintained that Trump was elected by an overwhelming majority of Americans, not saying he lost the popular vote by 3 million votes. That is a window into Trump reality -- how he sees things takes precedence over what actually happened. The President also believes the pipe bomber, along with the synagogue mass shooting, is slowing Republican momentum in the final week of the midterm election campaign. That is one of the reasons, aides said, he is making an unprecedented investment for a sitting president: 11 rallies in six days. \&quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if there&apos;s a midterm election or not, the President&apos;s going to fight back,\&quot; Sanders said. \&quot;The President is going to defend himself.\&quot; Rhetorical links The massacre widened a national debate over the President&apos;s divisive style started earlier in the week, when a fervent Trump supporter sent pipe bombs through the mail to people the President criticized. The angry and at times violent messages Trump espouses on his Twitter feed and during his campaign rallies led to accusations he was fomenting those impulses in his followers. It&apos;s an accusation that has infuriated the President, causing him to lash out in ways that only hardened the view that his words are mismatched for a somber national moment. Even aides who, in the past, have privately pushed back when Trump labels the news media the \&quot;enemy of the people\&quot; have this week agreed with his sentiments, arguing that no matter what the President does, the mainstream press won&apos;t be satisfied. That&apos;s led to a new level of combativeness, even as the country reels from hate attacks. And it&apos;s negated the President&apos;s weekend attempts at reconciliation, which were swiftly followed by rote political attacks and grievance-filled rants. \&quot;You guys have a huge responsibility to play in the divisive nature of this country,\&quot; Sanders said. \&quot;He got elected by an overwhelming majority of 63 million Americans, who came out and supported him and wanted to see his policies enacted. He&apos;s delivered on that. He&apos;s delivered on the promises he&apos;s made.  \&quot;If anything, I think it is sad and divisive, the way that every single thing that comes out of the media -- 90% of what comes out of the media&apos;s mouth -- is negative about this president,\&quot; she said, her tone having shifted from a tearful response to the Pittsburgh shooting to indignant criticism of the assembled reporters. She discarded concerns at the President&apos;s plans to continue politicking ahead of the midterm elections, despite the fraught national moment. \&quot;The President is going to continue to draw contrasts, particularly as we go into the final days of an election, the differences between the two parties, particularly on policy differences,\&quot; she said. The disconnect between Trump&apos;s rhetorical style and the traditional parameters of his job isn&apos;t mere coincidence. He ran vowing to dispense with the politically correct restraints of the past and has upheld that promise steadfastly. Even in moments of mourning, the President has downplayed the role a president can play in providing the country a moral or emotional grounding. &apos;He&apos;s my President&apos; In Pittsburgh, some progressive Jewish leaders have encouraged the President to stay home. In an open letter to the President, members of the city&apos;s \&quot;Bend the Arc\&quot; organization wrote that his words and policies over the past three years \&quot;have emboldened a growing white nationalist movement,\&quot; and that he is not welcome until he \&quot;fully (denounces) white nationalism.\&quot; But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at Tree of Life during Saturday&apos;s shooting, said that \&quot;the President of the United States is always welcome.\&quot; \&quot;I&apos;m a citizen. He&apos;s my President. He is certainly welcome,\&quot; he said. When Trump has met with victims&apos; families after mass shootings or natural disasters in the past, he has has conveyed a style of empathy that can sometimes feel stilted, particularly when compared to the freewheeling style he employs in most settings. He has yet to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service honoring the memories of Americans slain in gun violence or other attacks. When Trump met with family members of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting earlier this year, he was photographed clutching a notecard with handwritten prompts like \&quot;I hear you\&quot; and \&quot;What would you most want me to know about your experience?\&quot; -- a signal, at minimum, that some aides worried the usual signals of empathy may not come easily to him. The White House on Monday insisted the President had demonstrated the required compassion during trying times. \&quot;This is a President who has risen to that occasion and works to bring our country together in a number of occasions, whether it&apos;s the hurricanes, whether it&apos;s the Las Vegas shooting, whether it was the Pittsburgh shooting,\&quot; Sanders said.  Already, some Republicans have expressed concern that Trump&apos;s antagonistic campaign style will be aired on a split screen with expected funerals for shooting victims later this week. Trump plans an aggressive schedule of rallies ahead of next week&apos;s vote. Trump, meanwhile, has fretted that coverage of the mail bombings could distract from his midterm closing argument, which was built on dire warnings of a group of migrants seeking entry into the United States. Originally, Trump planned a major address on immigration this week, including the signing of a presidential proclamation that would prevent most, if not all, members of the group of migrants in Mexico heading toward the US from crossing the border. There are now discussions in the White House about delaying the planned immigration moves, a step that would be sure to frustrate Trump, who complained last week that the pipe bomb attempts distracted from an announcement on lowering drug prices.&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;What Democrats think of Pelosi&apos;s &apos;transitional&apos; pitch&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;POLITICS&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is billing herself as a \&quot;transitional\&quot; speaker who would bridge the current generation to the next, hoping to alleviate lingering concerns among some Democrats uncertain about electing her to the powerful position. But Pelosi hasn&apos;t fully detailed how that transition would work, and Democrats want some answers. \&quot;I think the bigger question is who would be the successor,\&quot; said Rep. Darren Soto of Florida, saying the caucus should soon come up with a plan. In conversations with CNN over the past week, Democratic members and aides acknowledge that Pelosi&apos;s promise to be a transitional leader has helped allay concerns that she would be speaker indefinitely if Democrats retake the House next month. And without any clear challenger, she remains a heavy favorite to become speaker in a Democratic majority -- even though some members say voters in their districts are eager to see change at the top. \&quot;I&apos;m sure people will want to know what her plans are, but until another candidate emerges to really put the heat on, she has some breathing room,\&quot; another Democratic member said. Soto, who has long endorsed the idea of a transition plan and supports Pelosi, said it would be helpful to know early on who would be the heir apparent.  \&quot;I think a lot of that will be determined in the elections,\&quot; he said, referring to the caucus elections next month that will determine not only the No. 1 spot in the caucus, but a spate of other leadership positions. Math problems loom Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker&apos;s gavel a decade ago, is confident she&apos;ll be speaker again but recently told the Los Angeles Times she&apos;s imagining a life beyond that, suggesting she&apos;s not planning to stay in the House forever. \&quot;I have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love.\&quot; The math may be tricky. Of 26 Democrats in toss-up races, 11 have said they would oppose Pelosi as speaker, while an additional 19 Democrats who are in districts that lean Democratic or are solidly in their party&apos;s favor said they would oppose her, according to a CNN tally. Those numbers grow among Democrats in districts that lean Republican. Pelosi can win the Democratic nomination to become speaker with only a simple majority in the caucus election. It gets more challenging in January, when the full House votes and she&apos;ll need 218 votes or whatever equates to a majority of the House at the time. If Democrats have a sizable majority -- say 230 or 240 -- Pelosi could afford to lose some support among her caucus on the floor and still win the speakership. If the majority is slim -- say 220 -- her pathway is more difficult.   That&apos;s where the transition argument could help, some members say, especially with incoming freshmen who campaigned on voting against her. \&quot;I think it might help some of those candidates who are getting blitzed with anti-Pelosi ads to be able to say she&apos;s not going to be there forever, and so it gives them a little bit of cover,\&quot; said another Democratic member who generally doesn&apos;t talk about leadership elections and asked not to be named. But there&apos;s another catch that could help Pelosi. House rules say a speaker is elected by a majority of members who cast votes for an individual on the floor. If members choose not to show up -- or vote \&quot;present\&quot; -- the threshold for becoming speaker is lowered. That happened in 2014, when then-Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, won 216 votes out of just 408 cast. Pelosi running on her leadership Pelosi allies say that if she&apos;s running, it&apos;s because she knows she has the votes. Moreover, she has the power of incumbency of sorts -- the ability to raise tens of millions for Democratic candidates as well as to dole out prized committee assignments critical for members to ascend the hierarchy in the caucus. She plans to call all her members to touch base before the midterm elections and immediately after. \&quot;If Nancy Pelosi&apos;s running for speaker, it&apos;s because we&apos;ve won the majority, and a lot of that will have been under her leadership in supporting our caucus and candidates across the country,\&quot; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. \&quot;And I think that will have taken away the argument that she&apos;s a drag on candidates.\&quot; Any vacancy at the top would trigger a dramatic contest for the speaker&apos;s job, with longtime leaders -- like House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn of South Carolina -- expected to run if Pelosi steps aside, as well as younger members who have their eyes on higher posts in the caucus. Hoyer and Clyburn have also made the \&quot;transition\&quot; argument in the past, but they are unlikely to take Pelosi on directly. Pelosi allies told CNN she has no intention of ceding the speakership and allowing Hoyer or Clyburn to be a bridge to the next generation of leaders. In other words, if she steps aside, she expects Hoyer or Clyburn to leave with her, sources said, though that decision will ultimately be up to those two men.  By all accounts, however, Pelosi appears to be going nowhere. \&quot;I fully expect that she&apos;ll be speaker,\&quot; said Rep. Ro Khanna of California, noting that if Democrats win, Pelosi would be at the helm of a major victory that includes a large number of female candidates. \&quot;I can&apos;t imagine how we would not ... allow her to at least claim the gavel.\&quot; Supporters of the transition idea also say it&apos;s a logical step when the caucus could be going through a major transition itself -- from the minority to the majority for the first time in eight years.  \&quot;I do think you need an experienced person at the top to help get that together and get us organized and off to a good start,\&quot; said Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois. Facing incoming freshmen, opposition from Democrats It&apos;s unclear, though, just how effective the pitch will be on incoming freshmen and on incumbent candidates who&apos;ve already vowed to oppose Pelosi -- some of whom she may need to hold the gavel once again. \&quot;I think it&apos;s time for somebody new,\&quot; said Paul Davis, a Democratic House candidate in Kansas, when asked about the idea of a transition.  Some of Pelosi&apos;s critics think her latest pitch is nothing more than political maneuvering. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who challenged Pelosi for minority leader in 2016 and lost, said in a recent radio interview with New Hampshire&apos;s WKXL that \&quot;it sounds like a strategy she has to keep people in her corner.\&quot; Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a vocal critic of Pelosi&apos;s, described her pitch as a \&quot;desperate\&quot; attempt to become speaker \&quot;at the expense of the Democratic Party.\&quot; Schrader told CNN that he and other incumbents who oppose Pelosi will provide a \&quot;safe place\&quot; for incoming freshmen this fall in Congress as they face pressure to go back on their campaign promise and support Pelosi on the floor.  \&quot;We respect the work she&apos;s done in the past, but there&apos;s always a time to move on,\&quot; he said. \&quot;Unfortunately, she doesn&apos;t see that right now.\&quot; In her recent comments, Pelosi declined to lay down any sort of timeline for when she would hand off the baton, saying she&apos;s not going to make herself a \&quot;lame duck.\&quot;  \&quot;There has to be a transition at some point in all of this,\&quot; Pelosi told CNN&apos;s Dana Bash at a CNN event last week.  Her allies say she&apos;s unlikely to detail a timeline after the elections either, not wanting to follow the model of current Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who announced his retirement from Congress months before he gives up the gavel. Still, as members digest the idea of a transitional leader, some want specifics. Another member who asked not to be named said the caucus would need \&quot;far greater clarity\&quot; on whether Pelosi would stay for \&quot;six months\&quot; or multiple years. \&quot;A transition could be a little more peaceful. The downside of that peace is the uncertainty.\&quot; While Pelosi has quietly and closely worked with some younger members to help them rise in the caucus, the minority leader told the LA Times that she would be hands off in the selection of the next generation of leaders. \&quot;Whoever is next is not up to me,\&quot; she said. \&quot;If I were saying, &apos;I want so-and-so to be my successor,&apos; that&apos;s not right.\&quot; And whether the transition idea is enough to satisfy her caucus -- particularly new members who distanced themselves from her on the campaign trail -- remains to be seen. \&quot;Her biggest challenge will be with new members who have pledged to publicly support someone else (plus, of course, the current members who don&apos;t want her),\&quot; said one Democratic member. \&quot;In the end, those things could be a real problem to reaching 218.\&quot;&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;USAG directs head tumbling coach for the 2018 U.S. World Championships Team to resign&quot;,

            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;US&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;USA Gymnastics has called for its head tumbling coach of the 2018 U.S. World Championships team to resign from that role pending an investigation into a report filed with a nonprofit aimed at eliminating abuse in amateur and professional sports.  Sergio Galvez also will not travel with the team to the 2018 Trampoline and Tumbling World Championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, set to be held from Nov. 7-10 \&quot;to maintain a safe environment for its athletes,\&quot; the sport&apos;s embattled governing body said Friday in a press release.  It is not clear what is alleged in the report filed with the US Center for SafeSport. The US Olympic Committee agency that oversees sexual misconduct and other abuse allegations reported to national governing bodies said it does not speak about specific matters according to its policy.  CNN could not reach Galvez on Monday.  In a separate statement to CNN on Monday, USAG said they \&quot;placed Galvez on the list of suspended and restricted individuals per the provisions in USA Gymnastics Bylaw 9.3\&quot; on Friday.  Online USAG records show Galvez is suspended pending a hearing. The records indicate Galvez is not to have any unsupervised contact with minor athletes. Friday&apos;s announcement comes amid turmoil for USA Gymnastics, which is struggling to recover from the sex abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar.  Nassar is the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics.  Earlier this month, the sport&apos;s governing body lost its second president in two months when former US Rep. Mary Bono stepped down as interim president. Bono had taken over just a month after embattled president and CEO Kerry Perry quit. Perry, who held the job for nine months, was criticized for what many people characterized as inadequate action during the Nassar abuse fallout. Bono came under fire in her first few days. In one instance, a September tweet surfaced of Bono defacing a Nike logo after Nike featured former NFL quarterback and civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick in its advertising campaign. (Nike is a major sponsor of Olympic champion Simone Biles, a mega star for USA Gymnastics.) Biles was critical of Bono. She tweeted: \&quot;don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,\&quot; Biles tweeted. Others also criticized Bono&apos;s tweet as being tone deaf, saying the suppression of athletes&apos; voices allowed Nassar&apos;s abuse to continue. Days after Bono&apos;s resignation, former USA Gymnastics head Steve Penny was arrested in connection with accusations he removed documents linked to the Nassar sexual abuse case from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas, authorities said. A judge set Penny&apos;s bail at $25,000.  Nassar was already serving 40 to 175 years in Michigan for sexually abusing women and girls under the guise of performing medical treatment when he was indicted in June on charges linked to allegations at the Karolyi Ranch.  He faces six counts of sexual assault of a child. Meanwhile, former USA Gymnastics trainer Deborah Van Horn is facing one count of sexual assault of a child in Texas, prosecutors said. On Monday, two former gymnasts said they plan to sue USA Gymnastics, the US Olympic Committee and \&quot;other enablers of this abuse.\&quot;  Tasha Schwikert, 33, is a former Olympian and her sister Jordan Schwikert, 32, is a former USA gymnastics national team member.  The recent news about Bono&apos;s hiring and Penny&apos;s arrest prompted her to come forward, Tasha Schwikert said.  \&quot;The most damning thing about all of this is abuse was happening to children. We must understand this was the culture that enabled Larry to position himself. I&apos;m outraged that USAG has yet to take responsibility for this child abuser,\&quot; she said.  Tasha Schwikert says USA Gymnastics created a toxic culture of abuse that \&quot;put its own self-interest before participants.\&quot;  In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it is \&quot;deeply sorry that Tasha and Jordan Schwikert, or any athlete, were abused by Larry Nassar during their gymnastics careers.  The organization has undergone significant reforms in the wake of his horrific acts that have impacted our athletes and community forever.\&quot;  USA Gymnastics said it does not comment on pending litigation.  USOC could not be immediately reached.&quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Bloomberg blames Trump for &apos;inciting&apos; hate after Pittsburgh shooting&quot;,
            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;politics&quot;,
            &quot;mappedSection&quot;: &quot;POLITICS&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Monday sharply criticized President Donald Trump&apos;s response to the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, saying Trump is partly responsible for the rise in hate and violence. \&quot;When he goes around getting people to scream and hate, bad things happen and you saw the results here,\&quot; said Bloomberg. He went on to say that the President \&quot;should be unifying and instead he is exciting people, inciting people.\&quot; Bloomberg, who has been openly flirting with a Democratic presidential bid in 2020, told CNN in an exclusive interview in Minnesota that there are consequences to words. \&quot;The President&apos;s words matter more than anybody else and his job, I&apos;ve always thought, is to be a unifier, not to be the leader of a party, but to be the leader of this country,\&quot; Bloomberg said.  The President has continued attacking the news media in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, as well last week&apos;s series of pipe bomb mailings to prominent Democrats and CNN.  Bloomberg said \&quot;perhaps\&quot; Trump did not understand he should seek to unify people, but stressed repeatedly in the interview that he believed Trump was using his position in an irresponsible way.  \&quot;You don&apos;t use the bully pulpit as the President of the United States to rile up people and say things as a joke or as a campaign promise,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;That&apos;s not what the President should be doing. The President&apos;s words matter. He&apos;s not an average person. He&apos;s the President, and with the presidency comes an obligation to set a moral standard for this country and to unite people.\&quot;  Bloomberg was careful, however, not to lay blame on Republicans generally. \&quot;Not every Republican is a racist,\&quot; he said. \&quot;Not every Republican agrees with the President.\&quot; When asked whether House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy should have sent and subsequently deleted a tweet which suggested that three billionaires (Bloomberg, George Soros and Tom Steyer) were buying the midterms, Bloomberg responded: \&quot;I think he shouldn&apos;t. The good thing is nobody knows who he is.\&quot; Bloomberg also said there are \&quot;an awful lot of Democrats that don&apos;t stand up.\&quot; \&quot;There&apos;s plenty of blame to go around this country on both sides,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;But I do think that if you look, the Republicans have been in control of the House and the Senate. They have not exercised their constitutional responsibility to provide a check and balance on the White House.\&quot; Yet to decide on 2020 Bloomberg declined to say if he will run for president in 2020, saying he is focused on the November 6 midterms.  The former New York mayor recently re-registered as a Democrat and has become an open antagonist of Trump heading into the midterms. The billionaire has pumped more than $110 million into efforts to support Democratic candidates around the country.  Bloomberg said that he would continue to consider a run even if former Vice President Joe Biden -- who Bloomberg described as a \&quot;competent American\&quot; -- jumps in the race. \&quot;I have a case to present, if I&apos;d like to present it,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;And if the public likes it, that&apos;s fine, and if they don&apos;t, that&apos;s what freedom of choice is.\&quot;  Bloomberg said if he were to run, he would present his record as \&quot;somebody who actually does things\&quot; and hopes voters would be receptive.  Bloomberg said while he thought \&quot;a large percentage\&quot; of Democrats would welcome him in the primaries, though he said he rejects some of the party&apos;s positions.  \&quot;I don&apos;t agree with everything that the Democratic establishment has dictated as their positions,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;I come from a world of being practical. ... Having grand schemes that we probably can&apos;t afford, that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t like, is a good way to elect Donald Trump to another four years.\&quot; Calls for gun control Bloomberg, who has increasingly tied his public profile to gun control, sat down with CNN alongside Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Bloomberg has been advocating for more gun safety laws for years. He formalized the effort with Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in 2006. The two created a coalition with other mayors around the country.  That group eventually morphed into Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that is backed by multiple donors of which Bloomberg is largest. Earlier Monday, Bloomberg publicly called for stricter gun control during an appearance in Detroit at CityLab, an event put on with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies.  He made the same appeal in St. Paul, Minnesota at an event for Moms Demand Action. \&quot;If more guns and fewer gun laws made America safer, we would be the safest country in the world,\&quot; Watts said. \&quot;Instead we have a 25 times higher gun homicide rate than any other high-income country. It&apos;s time for us as a country to stop letting gun lobbyists to write our nation&apos;s gun laws.\&quot; Bloomberg said he was recently in Pittsburgh and met with the mayor and community groups, including Moms Demand Action.  \&quot;It was really quite amazing, the enthusiasm they had and how they were so convinced that we were making progress -- and we are,\&quot; Bloomberg said. \&quot;But then we know that 11 people were killed a few days ago, six were injured at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and our hearts really have to go out to all of them.\&quot; In voicing support for stronger gun measures, Bloomberg said, \&quot;Nobody&apos;s trying to take away anybody&apos;s guns.\&quot; \&quot;We should have reasonable background checks,\&quot; Bloomberg added. \&quot;And don&apos;t sell guns to minors. Don&apos;t sell guns to people with psychiatric problems. Don&apos;t sell guns to people that have criminal records.\&quot;  Bloomberg said he thought local and state governments have had to step in on the issue \&quot;because the federal government is just hopeless.\&quot; His comments on Monday came after Trump said shortly after the shooting that there should have been an armed guard in the synagogue. Trump has likewise suggested arming teachers following school shootings, a position embraced by the National Rifle Association. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Bloomberg was referring to Moms Demand Action in his Detroit remarks. &quot;,

            &quot;headline&quot;: &quot;Trump considers State Dept spokeswoman Nauert for UN ambassador&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations, according to a senior Republican official with knowledge of the matter.  Nauert met with President Donald Trump on Monday, a source familiar with meeting told CNN. The former Fox News anchor joined the State Department in April 2017 as a spokesperson and is now acting undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs.  She has also previously worked as a health insurance consultant, according to the State Department.   Administration officials have been scrambling to fill the position after Nikki Haley announced in early October she would resign as ambassador to the UN by the end of the year. Haley&apos;s decision caught senior administration officials off guard and raised questions about the timing of her departure. She insisted she would not be running for president in 2020.  When Haley, a former governor of South Carolina, resigned, the President praised her as a \&quot;fantastic person\&quot; who has \&quot;done an incredible job\&quot; and said he would gladly welcome her back into his administration down the line.  Nauert is one of a few women the White House is considering to fill Haley&apos;s shoes.  Other possibilities The White House has reached out to Nancy Brinker asking if she would be open to consideration. Brinker, the founder of the Susan G. Komen foundation, has already gone through Senate confirmation as an ambassador, a GOP source close to the White House told CNN. The White House believes she could be fast-tracked to confirmation, making her a strong candidate. Kelly Craft, the current US ambassador to Canada, was considered for the UN ambassador post during the transition but lost out to Haley. Craft is also under consideration.  Kelly Ayotte, a former New Hampshire senator, has ties to the White House after serving as the \&quot;sherpa\&quot; for Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during his Senate confirmation hearings. Ayotte remains close to top Trump ally South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. Allies of hers say she would consider the job. Another name being floated is Kay Bailey Hutchison, who is currently the United States permanent representative to NATO, according to a US official. The official said Hutchinson has done well at NATO and and thinks Hutchinson would be easily confirmed. &quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;When Rabbi Hillel Norry walks though the valley of the shadow of death, he carries something more than a rod and a staff to comfort him. He tucks a large-caliber handgun in his waistband and keeps a watchful eye on his synagogue.  A black belt in Tae Kwon Do, Norry says he armed himself years ago after a man who had left anti-Semitic messages on his phone appeared at a synagogue he once led and threatened to harm him.  A lanky man with a salt-and-pepper beard, Norry says he is a man of peace -- he&apos;s a vegetarian who believes in \&quot;ethical eating.\&quot; But he also says it&apos;s ethical for clergy and parishioners to be armed. He cites the Bible&apos;s description of religious leaders as \&quot;shepherds\&quot; as proof.  \&quot;If we&apos;re the shepherds, the first job of the shepherd is to protect the flock from the wolf,\&quot; says Norry, a visiting rabbi at Congregation Beth Israel in Gulfport, Mississippi. \&quot;Why does a shepherd carry a stick? So he can whack the wolf.\&quot;  Some theological questions are abstract, but after an attack on a synagogue in Pennsylvania left 11 people dead, here&apos;s one that is urgent and raw:   What does the Bible say about arming clergy and people in the pews?   The slayings in Squirrel Hill, the heart of a Jewish community in Pittsburgh, is being called the worst attack on Jews in US history. It was also an assault on something else: the way communities of faith have operated for centuries.   Houses of worship are often called sanctuaries, a refuge from the world. Indeed, the scriptural reading in synagogues around the world Saturday focused on Abraham welcoming strangers, who turned out to be angels.  But Saturday&apos;s shooting was just the latest in a series of mass shootings in houses of worship where the stranger turned out to be armed. A white supremacist killed nine people at a shooting at a historic black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. And a gunman killed 26 worshippers at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017. \&quot;I hate that this keeps happening,\&quot; says the Rev. Brady Boyd, senior pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, which also became the site of a shooting in 2007. A gunman killed two church members and injured three others just as Sunday service ended.   Boyd cites a saying from Jesus in Matthew 10:16 to justify why he now has armed security at his church: Jesus said his followers should be \&quot;wise as serpents and harmless as doves.\&quot;  \&quot;Because people have been shot and killed on my campus, this is not theory to me,\&quot; says Boyd.  \&quot;I know what can happen if we&apos;re not prepared.\&quot;  Part of the preparation is scriptural. Just as people debate the Second Amendment in society, they debate bringing guns to worship in the religious world.   Here&apos;s how they use the Bible to justify their positions: Jesus said carry your cross, not your gun  The Rev. Tim McDonald III says he&apos;s heard clergy cite the Bible to justify arming clergy and congregants.  \&quot;That&apos;s absurd,\&quot; he says. \&quot;When you put that in a house of faith it goes against the tenets of our faith, that our trust is in God and not guns.\&quot;  McDonald and others who don&apos;t believe pastors or congregants should be armed cite many of the same scriptures:   Jesus rebukes a disciple who brandishes a sword to defend him, telling him in Matthew 26:52, \&quot;For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.\&quot;    The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians 10:4 that Christians should use weapons that \&quot;are not the weapons of the world.\&quot;  Jesus did not use violence to protect himself, as the writer says in 1 Peter 2:23: \&quot;When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.\&quot;   There are plenty of disagreements about what Jesus and his apostles did or said, some say, but not when it came to the use of violence. They were nonviolent to the bitter end.  \&quot;The apostles endure imprisonment, beatings, torture and martyrdom at the hands of their enemies, and never once lifted a finger to defend themselves through violent means,\&quot; wrote G. Shane Morris, in an essay on whether Christians should carry guns in church.  You can&apos;t find a scripture that justifies armed clergy, says McDonald, senior pastor of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta.   \&quot;I want them to show me; I guarantee you it&apos;s out of context,\&quot; McDonald says. \&quot;What did Jesus say, &apos;Those who live by the sword will also perish by the sword.&apos; You&apos;ve got to read the whole scripture, not the part that you want to use to support your position.\&quot;  McDonald says, however, that he sees no conflict with hiring armed and trained security in church. He says he has moved from a position of \&quot;no guns\&quot; to church security because of the recent attacks in houses of worship.  But he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit.  \&quot;A gun for me is based on fear -- you&apos;re expecting the worst,\&quot; McDonald says. \&quot;That goes against everything I believe. I expect the best. I&apos;m not going to live in fear. Our trust is in God, not in guns.\&quot;   Boyd, from Colorado Springs, says he respects pastors who believe they should be armed, but he won&apos;t carry a gun in the pulpit either.   It&apos;s not that he has anything against guns. He says he grew up in the Deep South where he was surrounded by guns. But the notion of an untrained pastor drawing down on a gunman from the pulpit as people flee a crowded sanctuary is unnerving.  \&quot;I am not for arming pastors,\&quot; he says. \&quot;We can actually do more harm than good. The last thing I want to do is to turn it into a Wild West shootout.\&quot;  Nor does he want people in his congregation to bring guns to church. Even with his church&apos;s history, he has a message for ordinary parishioners who bring guns to church. \&quot;We tell them to put it back in their cars,\&quot; he says.  &apos;Blessed be the Lord who trains my hands for war&apos;  Norry, the rabbi, has no theological problem with congregants who are trained in self-defense bringing guns to worship.  What, for example, would happen if a gunman first took out a security guard in a house of worship? Guards would be the first target of a gunman, he says. He wants a backup in his congregation because \&quot;police cannot prevent bad things; they respond to bad things.\&quot;  \&quot;If there had been four or five armed people in that synagogue, I don&apos;t know what would have happened,\&quot; he says of the congregation in Pittsburgh. \&quot;I tell you what, it would have changed the dynamic.\&quot;  Those like Norry who say the Bible justifies clergy and congregants bringing guns to worship cite similar passages: As opposition to him mounted, Jesus told his disciples in Luke: 22:36-38, \&quot;If you don&apos;t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.\&quot;   David, one of the heroes of the Old Testament, says in Psalms 144:1, \&quot;Blessed be the Lord, my rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle.\&quot;   Nehemiah 4:14 says, \&quot;Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.\&quot;   And Genesis 14:14 is one of Norry&apos;s favorites. It tells a story of Abraham, considered the father of the Jewish faith:  \&quot;When Abraham heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.\&quot;  \&quot;He goes with a militia of people,\&quot; Norry says. \&quot;He gathers arms and people to rescue his kidnapped nephew. He doesn&apos;t pray to God, &apos;Help me make peace among the nations.&apos; He goes ready to make battle.\&quot;  Norry says he doesn&apos;t relish the thought of violence. He calls himself a man of peace. He was reluctant to even talk about the fact that he is armed in worship. And he described President Trump&apos;s comments that an armed guard inside the synagogue would have stopped Saturday&apos;s attack as  \&quot;tone deaf.\&quot;   But his experience and the headlines have made him wonder what he would do if a gunman were to burst into his synagogue or attack his family.  He says violence is justified, \&quot;even holy,\&quot; when it comes to protecting your children and your congregation.  \&quot;How is fighting back worse? I don&apos;t understand that position,\&quot; he says. \&quot;In that moment, you have to fight. You can talk about reducing hate. I&apos;m for that. But why would you want to make me defenseless?\&quot;  It&apos;s not a Biblical passage, but Norry can think of another use of words that could possibly prevent more mass shootings in houses of worship.  He cites the signs that churches and other communities often put up to attract visitors. They&apos;re often bristling with scriptures, perky uplifting messages and times of services.  Norry thinks it might be time to change some of those signs.  They would still welcome the stranger.   But they would send another message to the wolf that shows up at the door.  \&quot;How about signs that said, &apos;Our congregation is trained and prepared to fight back. Go somewhere else.&apos;  \&quot;I bet you somebody would think twice about messing with that congregation.\&quot;&quot;,
