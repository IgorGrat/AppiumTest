    =&gt;  &quot;At 30-years-old, Yu Kikuchi was tired of his job. Working in an assembly line that made turbines, he was aching to find a new lease on life. So when he heard about 80-year-old master blacksmith Kosaku Matsumura who made “nata,” or Japanese hatchets, he knew he had found his calling. He moved to the countryside and asked Matsumura to take him on as an apprentice. While Kikuchi has less than thee years of experience under his belt compared to Matsumura&apos;s 50, the young man still hopes to one day be at the level of his master. When the time comes, he hopes to take on an apprentice of his own, passing on the blacksmith’s torch. This Great Big Story was inspired by Genesis.&quot;

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;White House turnover is coming, why the press secretary job has become less important, Democrats pounce after McConnell suggests entitlement cuts, and why 2018 gubernatorial races are so important. It&apos;s all on Inside Politics. &quot;,

            &quot;section&quot;: null,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;In Montana, the most dedicated product testers in the industry get ready to work every day. They problem solve, put their hairy, hairy backs into it and get the job done. Never mind that they’re 600-pound grizzly bears. When bears become habituated to human food, they are often considered dangerous and are either killed or put into captivity. So to keep both bears and people safe, the Bear and Wolf Discovery Center in Montana uses large grizzlies to test bear-resistant products. If the bears are unable to break into a cooler or trashcan in one hour, they get the grizzly seal of approval. If not, the bears get a much deserved lunch break.&quot;,

            &quot;section&quot;: null,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;At 30-years-old, Yu Kikuchi was tired of his job. Working in an assembly line that made turbines, he was aching to find a new lease on life. So when he heard about 80-year-old master blacksmith Kosaku Matsumura who made “nata,” or Japanese hatchets, he knew he had found his calling. He moved to the countryside and asked Matsumura to take him on as an apprentice. While Kikuchi has less than thee years of experience under his belt compared to Matsumura&apos;s 50, the young man still hopes to one day be at the level of his master. When the time comes, he hopes to take on an apprentice of his own, passing on the blacksmith’s torch.\r\n\r\nThis Great Big Story was inspired by  Genesis.&quot;,

    =&gt;  &quot;At 30-years-old, Yu Kikuchi was tired of his job. Working in an assembly line that made turbines, he was aching to find a new lease on life. So when he heard about 80-year-old master blacksmith Kosaku Matsumura who made “nata,” or Japanese hatchets, he knew he had found his calling. He moved to the countryside and asked Matsumura to take him on as an apprentice. While Kikuchi has less than thee years of experience under his belt compared to Matsumura&apos;s 50, the young man still hopes to one day be at the level of his master. When the time comes, he hopes to take on an apprentice of his own, passing on the blacksmith’s torch. This Great Big Story was inspired by Genesis.&quot;

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;White House turnover is coming, why the press secretary job has become less important, Democrats pounce after McConnell suggests entitlement cuts, and why 2018 gubernatorial races are so important. It&apos;s all on Inside Politics. &quot;,

            &quot;section&quot;: null,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;In Montana, the most dedicated product testers in the industry get ready to work every day. They problem solve, put their hairy, hairy backs into it and get the job done. Never mind that they’re 600-pound grizzly bears. When bears become habituated to human food, they are often considered dangerous and are either killed or put into captivity. So to keep both bears and people safe, the Bear and Wolf Discovery Center in Montana uses large grizzlies to test bear-resistant products. If the bears are unable to break into a cooler or trashcan in one hour, they get the grizzly seal of approval. If not, the bears get a much deserved lunch break.&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;At 30-years-old, Yu Kikuchi was tired of his job. Working in an assembly line that made turbines, he was aching to find a new lease on life. So when he heard about 80-year-old master blacksmith Kosaku Matsumura who made “nata,” or Japanese hatchets, he knew he had found his calling. He moved to the countryside and asked Matsumura to take him on as an apprentice. While Kikuchi has less than thee years of experience under his belt compared to Matsumura&apos;s 50, the young man still hopes to one day be at the level of his master. When the time comes, he hopes to take on an apprentice of his own, passing on the blacksmith’s torch.\r\n\r\nThis Great Big Story was inspired by  Genesis.&quot;,

            &quot;section&quot;: &quot;tv&quot;,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;White House turnover is coming, why the press secretary job has become less important, Democrats pounce after McConnell suggests entitlement cuts, and why 2018 gubernatorial races are so important. It&apos;s all on Inside Politics. &quot;,

            &quot;section&quot;: null,
            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;In Montana, the most dedicated product testers in the industry get ready to work every day. They problem solve, put their hairy, hairy backs into it and get the job done. Never mind that they’re 600-pound grizzly bears. When bears become habituated to human food, they are often considered dangerous and are either killed or put into captivity. So to keep both bears and people safe, the Bear and Wolf Discovery Center in Montana uses large grizzlies to test bear-resistant products. If the bears are unable to break into a cooler or trashcan in one hour, they get the grizzly seal of approval. If not, the bears get a much deserved lunch break.&quot;,

            &quot;body&quot;: &quot;At 30-years-old, Yu Kikuchi was tired of his job. Working in an assembly line that made turbines, he was aching to find a new lease on life. So when he heard about 80-year-old master blacksmith Kosaku Matsumura who made “nata,” or Japanese hatchets, he knew he had found his calling. He moved to the countryside and asked Matsumura to take him on as an apprentice. While Kikuchi has less than thee years of experience under his belt compared to Matsumura&apos;s 50, the young man still hopes to one day be at the level of his master. When the time comes, he hopes to take on an apprentice of his own, passing on the blacksmith’s torch.\r\n\r\nThis Great Big Story was inspired by  Genesis.&quot;,
